# Design axes — the composition menu

*(added 2026-07-16; distilled from a hand-picked corpus of 80 ICML 2026 posters
chosen for borrowable techniques. Numbers like `65626` are anchor poster IDs
from that corpus — re-fetch any of them at
`https://icml.cc/media/PosterPDFs/ICML%202026/<id>.png` if you need to see the
construction, compositing alpha onto white.)*

Every poster is composed by choosing **one option per axis** below, plus 0–2
devices. Axes are orthogonal: no option on one axis may silently bind another
axis (that is enforced by the clash rules at the bottom, not by bundling).
An axis choice is a **primary option plus small modifiers** — treat each axis
as a structured object, never a single mutually-exclusive enum.

`templates/THEMES.md` holds the color-bundle pool and re-theming mechanics;
`templates/COMPONENTS.md` holds per-component contracts. This file is the
menu of *what to compose*.

## Axis 1 — Layout skeleton (`base topology + span modifier + focal content`)

| base topology | notes | anchors |
|---|---|---|
| 4-column | shipped default (`landscape_4col_neutral`) | 61119, 63713 |
| 3-column | the most common skeleton in the corpus; wider equations/figures | 62396, 64164, 66740 |
| 2-column vertical flow | portrait venues (`portrait_2col_neutral`) | 63574, 66429 |
| hero panel 1.5fr+1fr | shipped (`landscape_hero_neutral`) | — |
| center stage + wings | colored/dark middle track ~45–55%, light side tracks | 60655, 64621, 65263, 67229 |
| asymmetric display-title column | title owns a full vertical track | 63136, 61403 |
| horizontal band-rows | rows, not columns; needs a side or top nav signal | 65626, 66466, 63290 |
| mosaic / named-area grid | modules span rows/cols; dashboard feel | 63300, 63640, 65372 |
| top hero + bottom grid | full-width top region, results grid below | 66579, 62378 |
| radial hub *(rare)* | central wheel + satellites; hard to balance | 67039, 63682 |

- `span modifier`: none / top-hero / full-width mid band. `focal content`: the
  hero region may hold a figure (60655), a statement (64621), a metric wall
  (62378), or the title itself (63136) — say which.
- Canvas orientation is venue metadata (an input), never a style choice.
  When the input says portrait, pick the skeleton from the portrait
  translation table below — same menu, translated geometry.
- Ownership: this axis reserves *geometry* (e.g. a title track, a stage);
  how the title/identity is arranged inside it belongs to Axis 8.

### Axis 1 · portrait translations

The 10-topology menu above is distilled from a landscape corpus, and most of
its geometry assumes width is cheap. This table is calibrated for the
**~24 in-wide portrait class** — 24×36 in boards and the near-identical
61×91 cm ICLR-workshop spec. There, usable width is ~2 columns, so the cheap
direction is the full-width row, and the unprompted reading order is
top-to-bottom (the board is also just small: ~40% of a 60×36 board's area, so
width economics *and* total capacity both bite). Translate the topology —
keep its *idea*, move its focal geometry onto full-width rows — rather than
improvising, and rather than collapsing every portrait poster onto the
shipped 2-col default (the anti-convergence fingerprint axes include the
layout skeleton). Anchors are the landscape originals that demonstrate the
technique; there is no portrait corpus yet.

| landscape base | portrait form (~24 in wide) | notes & anchors |
|---|---|---|
| 2-column vertical flow | as-is — shipped default (`portrait_2col_neutral`) | 63574, 66429 |
| horizontal band-rows | **full-width band stack** | the most portrait-native skeleton; bands stack in reading order, so the landscape row's "side or top nav signal" note is satisfied by numbered band headers (Axis 7 markers) alone. 65626, 66466 |
| top hero + bottom grid | **top hero band + 2-col grid** | hero band up to ~40% of body height. 66579, 62378 |
| hero panel 1.5fr+1fr | ⚠ side-by-side is legal but weak — usually give the hero a full-width top or mid band instead | side-by-side leaves a ~9 in support column (short cards only) and a ~13.6 in hero track, barely wider than a plain 2-col column, so the drama mostly evaporates |
| center stage + wings | **mid-stage band** | the stage rotates 90°: a full-width middle band (~45–55% of body height), support zones above and below. 60655, 64621 |
| mosaic / named-area grid | **2-col × N-row named grid** | landscape's cross-column freedom compresses to **row-spans** on a 2-track grid; the gate-compatible build is two `column` stacks whose complementary per-column row tracks stagger the seams (the role model only expresses sequential column stacks — modules each posing as a `column` would put mid-poster bottoms into the measure spread). 63300, 63640, 65372 |
| asymmetric display-title column | **title spine** (a narrow rotated title rail, ~3–4 in) *or* **playbill top block** (the title owns the top ~20–25% as display geometry — a focal region, not a masthead row) | 63136, 61403; hard rule 3 binds Axis 8 in both forms |
| radial hub | ⚠ constrained; the usually-better portrait analog is the **central spine** — a vertical axis down the middle, satellite cards alternating left/right on staggered half-rows | satellite columns ≈ 7 in, hub ≈ 8 in — the same width class as the ⚠ 3-col row, with radial's balance problem on top |
| 3-column | ⚠ columns ≈ 7.3 in — list/bullet content only; prose measures too narrow | — |
| 4-column | ✗ below minimum readable column width | — |

- **A0 portrait (33.1×46.8 in) is a different size class** — don't carry the
  24-in numbers over: 3-col columns are ~10.4 in (comfortable), 4-col ~7.7 in
  (drops to the ⚠ class), a side-by-side hero leaves a ~12.7 in support
  column (viable), radial returns to its landscape "rare, hard to balance"
  status, and capacity is ~72% of a 60×36 board. The full-width-row
  translations above still work on A0; they just stop being forced.
- Span modifiers and focal content transfer unchanged; on a narrow board a
  full-width row is the cheap move, a reserved side track the expensive one.
- Capacity: at 24×36 the same content volume reads one Axis-5 step denser
  than on 60×36 (landscape-balanced ≈ portrait-dense) — budget content down
  before type size (clash rule 1).
- The narrow-header masthead rules (logo stacking above the QR, one-line
  footer blocks) live in SKILL.md and apply to every skeleton here. On the
  **title-spine** form the `header` role is a vertical rail; polish's Gate E
  detects it automatically (header taller than 1.5× its width) and swaps the
  horizontal-masthead calibrations (logo ≤ 22% of header *width*,
  right-block ≤ 32%, TITLE-SQUEEZED/-OFFCENTER, the logo↔QR height match)
  for rail checks: logos are capped by the rail's content width and blocks
  are checked against all four rail edges. LOGO/BROKEN stays unconditional.
  The polish summary prints a `vertical rail` line when the mode is active —
  if that line is missing on a title-spine poster, the header role landed on
  the wrong element. Stack rail logos/QR with `.logo-row.logo-stack`.
- Measure roles: `column` is only for **card stacks that end at the shared
  bottom line** (a band stack is ONE full-width column, each band a `card`;
  the measure gate computes bottom-spread across all column/hero bottoms). A
  full-width hero/stage band is `band` (excluded from spread like `banner`,
  but its content keeps the clipping / broken-image / letterbox
  checks), **not** `hero` (`hero` means a terminal panel that bottom-aligns
  with the columns) and not `banner` (reserve that for the thin framework
  banner; wave-3 posters predate the `band` role and still carry `banner`
  stage bands). Support blocks *above* a mid band must not be `column`s
  either — wrap that whole upper region in a `band`. `card` only nests under
  `column`/`hero` (preflight), so band-internal modules carry no role. Two
  caveats: `band` must hang directly under `poster`, never inside a
  `body`-role region (preflight); and the gates scan only the band container
  itself, not author-built inner clip boxes — still eyeball the band in the
  print-emulated render (the `render_preview` PDF/PNG, not a screen view).

## Axis 2 — Canvas (`base + treatment + coverage`)

- **base**: white / cream (64736, 66466, 65205) / light tint (63507, 65748) /
  brand hue (67218 sage, 60839) / near-black (65626, 66072).
- **treatment**: flat / gradient (63507, 66383) / textured-decorated *(rare;
  whole-page ornament belongs here, per-module ornament belongs to Axis 6)*
  (60839 constellation, 66372 gilt page frame).
- **coverage**: full / split two-tone (64621 white+crimson center, 65263,
  65469, 67229) / visible gutter-as-frame — cards sit edge-to-edge and the
  canvas shows only in the gutters, reading as a frame (65423 dark slate,
  67218 pale sage; the gutter color is just `base`).

## Axis 3 — Palette (`role topology + hue relationship + paint modifier`)

- **role topology**: accent-only / accent + emphasis register `--emph`
  (shipped default; pool & derivation in SKILL.md + THEMES.md) /
  dual-semantic — two hues carry two fixed meanings poster-wide (64834
  green=language vs orange=translation) / categorical multi-role (63640,
  65372, 66057; style rule 4 caps at two declared hue slots (accent/emph),
  so categorical palettes keep rule 4 disabled — posterly's default — and
  record the full palette in the poster's `DESIGN DIRECTION` block).
- **hue relationship**: distinct centers / **same-center tonal** — emphasis by
  lightness/saturation only, one hue family (63819). This is a legitimate
  choice; the emphasis register does NOT have to be hue-distinct.
- **paint modifier**: solid / gradient-as-identity on display type or arrows
  (67122, 63300) / neon — requires dark ground + luminous frame, see clash
  rule 4 (66072).

## Axis 4 — Typography (`base voice + accent convention`)

- **base voice**: LaTeX-serif paper (62587, 66740, 65107) / serif display +
  sans body (64736, 67045) / grotesque (65423, 67122, 60655) /
  rounded-playful (60472, 64049).
- **accent convention** (stackable on any voice): none / letterspaced
  small-caps eyebrows (64736, 65626, 61797) / mono accents for code, numerals,
  URLs (66427, 66466, 67122).
- Font families must be on the style-gate whitelist or declared via the
  `--tokens` `fonts:` extension; vendor any webfont locally (never a CDN).
- **Condensed poster faces are giant-word faces — split the duty into two
  spacing tiers.** An ultra-condensed, tight-sidebearing display face (Anton
  and its Bebas-style kin) is built for one or two short words set huge; its
  native tracking is too tight for a multi-word masthead, and an uppercase
  multi-word setting always needs positive tracking on top. When such a face
  carries the title, give the *title tier* `letter-spacing: .03–.06em` and
  `line-height ≥ 1.0`, while the *giant-word tier* (a lone display word or
  symbol) may keep the native tight set or even negative tracking — same
  face, two breathing registers. If you don't want to manage tiers, keep the
  condensed face for the giant words only and set the title in a
  normal-width companion face.

## Axis 5 — Density & rhythm

`sparse showcase` (60655, 64621, 67122) / `balanced` (64736, 66653) /
`dense report` (60839, 62396, 65221). Drives the font-scale, padding and
gutter tokens together. This is a *capacity decision*: if content does not
fit, change topology/density or cut content — never shrink body text below
the floor (clash rule 1).

## Axis 6 — Card surface & frame (`surface × frame-line × elevation`)

- **surface**: transparent (no card; 64164, 67122) / canvas-tint (66243,
  66429 grey fills) / white / brand slab (66579, 66057) / white cards floating
  on a colored canvas (63507, 67218).
- **frame-line**: none / hairline / thin colored (65714, 66774) / thick
  colored (63300, 67045, 63713) / dashed (62901, 66383) / luminous outline
  (66072) / ornamental (66372).
- **elevation**: flat / shadow / outer glow (dark grounds only, rule 5).
- **modifiers** (compose with any frame): left-edge admonition bar (66427,
  61312) / corner type-tab "Lemma/Def/Theorem" (62998) / edge-attached
  subclaim chips riding a card edge (66057).
- **secondary/inner profile**: nested modules may declare a second frame
  profile (63640: soft outer card, dashed square inner boxes; 60839, 65372) —
  instantiate only when the design actually nests.
- Corner radius: `--rs` scales every element class proportionally (1 = shipped
  soft look, 0 = square). Per-class overrides only when a design needs
  cross-class divergence (square cards + pill chips).
- Figure mount: paper figures follow the frame decision through `--fig-bg` /
  `--fig-frame` (ground + keyline on `.figure img` / `.ff-fig img`). Restyle
  the mount together with the cards so figures sit *in* the design rather than
  pasted on it; `--fig-frame: transparent` gives a frameless mount.

## Axis 7 — Section-heading joint (`joint shape + marker + content form`)

The richest axis in the corpus, and invisible until you look for it.

- **joint shape**: plain title (63953) / underline rule (65287, 66243) /
  trailing rule to the card edge (63030, 61312) / full-width solid bar
  (61273, 63136, 64164, 67229; capsule-bar variant 63819) / floating pill
  above the card (63640) / **fieldset-legend** — the title breaks the border
  line (66774, 63030) / **ribbon-tab riding the border** — a solid capsule
  overlapping the frame's top edge, centered (62901 on a dashed frame) /
  centered title with short flanking dashes (64834, 63713) / vertical rotated
  rail (65221, 62054) / margin-detached side tabs (60472) / chevron banner
  (64618).
- **marker**: none / number chip (63757, 64736, 63574, 61894) / giant numeral
  + eyebrow (65626, 66466) / icon (60505).
- **content form**: nominal label / claim sentence as heading (66207, 67122) /
  question form (65205, 63210) / two-tier eyebrow + headline (61797, 61894).
- The three sub-choices combine freely (number chip + question form is fine).

## Axis 8 — Masthead & footer (`masthead + footer + identity accessory`)

- **masthead**: plain centered row with corner logos (62396, 65372) /
  left-aligned no band (66429, 67122) / brand color band (63030, 65423,
  62378, 65748) / title in a slab or inside the stage (60655, 63300; stage
  geometry is Axis 1's) / eyebrow + display masthead (64736) / demoted title +
  promoted question hero (66579, 67122) / project wordmark (65221, 64049,
  66466).
- **footer**: none / contact strip / manifesto band — one actionable sentence
  plus a few metrics (65205 "Front-load your dropout.", 61797, 60839) /
  sandwich — footer echoes the masthead band (63627, 64834, 64160).
- **identity accessory**: logo wall / QR-CTA component with labeled tags
  (65372 "SCAN ME", 65748) / logo+QR side rail (65626, 66579) / faint corner
  watermark (`.ornament`, a LEGACY option shipped commented-out — superseded by
  the identity-v1 `corner-signature` below; leave it disabled).
- All three sub-choices are independent (63030 = brand band + footer strip).

**posterly identity mark — always-on, and deliberately exempt.** Distinct from
the *decorative* `.ornament` is posterly's **identity mark**: the `⊕`
registration glyph, shipped LIVE in every template as the `corner-signature`
(bottom-right padding safe zone) plus an authoring-time `woven-signature` riding
existing content (both catalogued in COMPONENTS.md). It is a **deliberately
retained cross-poster invariant** — it does NOT count toward anti-convergence
distance (that metric compares only the five visual fingerprint axes below, and
the identity mark is none of them), but it does carry a **controlled,
low-salience visual cost**. The corner mark (~7 mm, low-contrast, in the
padding) stays below thumbnail-level design personality; the woven mark avoids
reading as a fixed fingerprint only if its host, scale, local ground and semantics
vary per poster — an authoring discipline nothing verifies. "Exempt from the metric" is not "perceptually invisible" — keep the
woven host varied, and leave the decorative `.ornament` disabled (the
`corner-signature` supersedes it under identity-v1). Anonymous venues set
`data-ps-identity="off"` to remove both (SKILL.md Step 0).

device) · metric scoreboard (62378 four colored numerals, 64736, 65205,

## Clash rules

**Hard (check, don't debate):**

1. Capacity gate: content volume × layout × density must satisfy the minimum
   font/padding floors. If it doesn't fit, change an axis or cut content;
   never shrink body text.
2. Fieldset/ribbon joints need a real border (`frame-line ≠ none`) **and
   reserved clearance above every card that carries one** — ≥ half the title
   chip's rendered height, on top of the surrounding row gap (the first body
   row sits closest to the banner/header, where the default grid gap is far
   too small; an unreserved chip lands inside the section above, and
   `measure`'s collision gate hard-fails the overprint). Implement via the
   catalogued `card--legend` recipe (COMPONENTS.md) — never a hand-tuned
   negative margin — and keep legend titles to ONE line (the transform still
   centres a wrapped chip, but the first line then sits fully outside the
   card and the required half-height clearance grows). Side tabs need
   reserved margin; a vertical rail needs band-row
   structure and track width.
3. Masthead mode must match Axis-1 reserved geometry (display-title column
   masthead → layout has a title track; title-in-stage → layout has a stage).
4. Neon paint → low-luminance ground + luminous outline or glow. Never on
   white.
5. Glow/luminous effects only where the *local* background is dark (a white
   poster with one dark slab may glow inside the slab only).
6. Transparent surfaces: check ink contrast against the worst point of the
   actual backdrop (split/gradient grounds included). Imported figures on
   dark grounds need a light plate or an inverted rendition.
7. Semantic carry-through: a hue that carries a meaning keeps it poster-wide;
   categorical palettes pass distinctness + color-blind checks; a claimed
   semantic hue is never reused decoratively.
8. Attached/nested constructions: edge-attached chips and floating pills must
   not be clipped (`overflow`) or collide with the block above; a secondary
   inner frame must survive a global "borders off" choice.
9. Text on gradients/slabs: contrast computed at the worst-contrast point
   under the text, not the average color.

**Soft (legal but weigh deliberately):** shadows on dark grounds (avoid only
low-contrast grey drop shadows — outlines/glow/inner shadows fine, 66072) ·
borderless layouts need *some* alternative grouping signal (gap, rules,
heading bars, alignment — not necessarily bigger gaps) · sparse density with
4 columns · cream canvas with grotesque type · tonal palette with a metric
scoreboard.

## Recipes

The seven named recipes (宣言色板 / 纸感学术 / 暗夜编辑 / 奶油刊头 / 工程报告 /
机构单色 / 粉彩圆角) are intended as **per-axis default bundles with
compatibility notes** — starting points, not packages. The full per-axis
write-ups are not yet in this file; until they land, each name works as a
ready-made **concept statement** (SKILL.md Step 2.5) naming the world the
poster lives in — adopt the name as the concept and compose the eight axes
yourself. Once the write-ups land, swapping any single axis out of a recipe
stays normal; re-check that the new pick still serves the concept, plus the
clash rules — nothing more.

## Anti-convergence

Consecutive posters in a wave must differ on at least two of: layout
skeleton, canvas, frame-line, section-heading joint, masthead — and must not
reuse the previous poster's concept statement. The shipped default (4-col
landscape / 2-col portrait skeleton · white · soft card · plain headings ·
centered masthead) counts as one combo — do not let every poster collapse
back to it. A single poster outside any wave follows the same spirit: the
default combo may be locked only with a recorded one-line justification in
the `DESIGN DIRECTION` block, and a tie between candidates breaks toward the
distinctive one, not the home position.
