"""Soft visual-polish gate — runs at Step 6.

Gates the hard alignment gate cannot see:

  - **Gate A: figure sizing by aspect ratio.** A wide figure (AR > 1.3)
    rendered at 38% of card width wastes 60% of the column even when
    columns align. The defaults match the documented "aim for" lower
    bounds in SKILL.md so any figure inside the recommended range
    passes cleanly.
  - **Gate B: typography orphans + prose widows.** (1) ``1.18-1.30× ↑``
    whose ``↑`` wrapped alone onto its own line. Detected on elements with
    ``[class*="stat"]`` / ``[class*="num"]`` / ``.takeaway-num`` /
    ``.headline-num`` that end with a known orphan-prone glyph but
    lack ``white-space: nowrap``. (2) ``WIDOW``: a ``.callout`` /
    ``.body-text`` / ``.caption`` / ``.section-title`` / ``.card p`` /
    ``.card li`` / ``.fb-text`` (or a ``<br>`` segment of one) that wraps
    so its last visual line is a stranded runt -- filling less than 35%
    of the widest line (the framework banner ``.fb-text`` carries a higher
    ~80% bar: it must read as a filled rectangle, not merely avoid a runt).
    Judged by the last
    line's WIDTH as a fraction of the measure (not word count), so a short
    two-word tail flags and a single long word filling the line does not.
    A trailing figure/icon/table keeps the last line unjudgeable, but a short
    text tail ending in inline math (``by $\\lambda$.``) is caught.
    Long running prose (> the char cap) and GENERIC blocks -- any block-ish
    element holding worded text, discovered by geometry so custom-skeleton
    class names are covered -- are judged by the conservative bar only: a
    stranded tail of at most two words under the runt width. TABLE cells ride
    that bar too, from four words up (a shorter label breaks where the column
    width says it must, not where the copy does). (3) ``GLUE-CHAIN``: >= 3
    words fused with ``&nbsp;`` (the lazy widow "fix") -- the unbreakable
    unit wraps early as a whole and tears a hole in the line above; stat /
    math / list idioms are exempt (< 3 prose words, or a pure separator
    token in the chain). (4) ``TEXT-WRAP`` census: when >= 3 wrapped blocks
    carry neither ``text-wrap: pretty`` nor ``balance``, the templates'
    protective defaults were dropped (the custom-skeleton failure mode).
  - **Gate C: space-between fill.** ``justify-content: space-between``
    on a column with one short card produces a giant whitespace gap
    that reads as "this column ran out of things to say". Detected
    when the largest inter-card gap exceeds the column's stated
    ``row-gap`` by > 5% of column height. Two card-level siblings catch
    the same void inside a single card: ``CARD/TRAILING`` (blank BELOW
    the last line of a stretched card) and ``CARD/INNER-VOID`` (a gap in
    the MIDDLE of a card, below the last real block and above a child
    pinned to the bottom by ``margin-top: auto`` / ``justify-content:
    space-*`` -- the equal-height-row-with-unequal-content case, which
    ``CARD/TRAILING`` misses because the pinned tail makes trailing ~0).
    ``TRACK/INNER-VOID`` extends the same geometry to header/footer tracks
    (a vertical masthead spine / side rail), which are neither measure
    columns nor ``.card`` -- the wave-2 spine stretched by
    ``space-between`` shipped two ~500 px voids with every gate green.
  - **Gate G: composed text/ground contrast.** ``style_check`` verifies
    DECLARED token pairs; Gate G samples what actually RENDERED: each text
    run's foreground against the alpha-composited ground beneath it, WCAG
    ratio floored at ``--min-contrast`` (default 3.0 -- flags only
    unambiguous defects; deliberate muted inks sit ~3.5+). Text over
    images/gradients is skipped (verify those on the rendered crop). The
    recurring incident class: an inline emphasis/highlight class that sets
    a background but inherits text color from a different ground.
  - **SYMBOL-CASE: uppercase transform vs lowercase Greek.** A text run
    whose computed ``text-transform`` is ``uppercase`` and that holds
    lowercase Greek (or the micro sign, which uppercases to a Latin-M
    lookalike ``Μ``) paints the symbol as its capital — ``α`` renders as
    ``Α``, glyph-identical to Latin ``A`` in most faces (``SHARPEN α>1``
    prints as ``SHARPEN A>1``) — while the SOURCE stays correct, so only
    the rendered sheet shows the corruption. Wrap the symbol in a
    ``text-transform: none`` span (templates ship ``.tt-none``) or drop
    the transform on that element.

Warns by default; ``--strict`` to exit non-zero. Hard-fails if the
poster has no ``[data-measure-role]`` markup at all — a polish PASS on
"0 figures, 0 columns, 0 stat elements" would be misleading.
