"""Alignment + gap-to-strip measurement — the HARD gate.

This is the only gate that decides whether columns visually align. It
print-emulates the HTML in headless Chromium, reads the geometry of
every ``[data-measure-role]`` element, and reports two numbers:

  - **spread**: max−min of last-card-bottoms across all columns
    (plus any hero panel). Aim < 3 px; default fail threshold 5 px.
  - **gap → footer-strip/footer**: distance from the last card's
    bottom to the next horizontal strip. Aim [30, 50] px so card
    shadows clear but cards don't visually float.

Non-negotiables built in: an empty column hard-fails (fallback to
column.bottom is risky); missing footer-strip/footer hard-fails; a
MathJax typeset error / timeout / silent CDN block hard-fails; content
escaping a card's box (a negative-margin "legend" title, a transformed
chip) that lands inside a neighbouring section hard-fails.

    # grossly displaced poster is caught by position-align above; a
    # correctly-placed poster with a left-bled child stays an eyeball
    # gap). Any positive delta is genuine root scrollable overflow -- most
    # often the implicit-column case below, but equally e.g. a child
    # sliding under a thick opaque border, or an off-canvas hidden /

    # implicit `auto` column grows to a wide child's max-content and

    # axis with `grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 1fr)` (or a track set
    # summing to the content width) -- the same minmax(0,.) defense the
    # body rows already carry.

    # number below) still looks clean. The classic trap is a flex
    # card/column/hero: when its overflow is hidden/scroll/auto its
    # `min-height: auto` is floored toward 0, so flexbox shrinks the
    # over-full item back inside its track and clips the overflow -- turning
    # a too-full poster into a false PASS. (A fixed-/max-height box with any
    # non-visible overflow clips the same way, without the flex step.) Catch
    # it directly by comparing scroll-size to client-size on the role
    # containers themselves.

    # Scope is deliberately those role containers (card, column, hero,
    # band), NOT a full-descendant sweep: the latter trips over MathJax's
    # off-screen `<mjx-assistive-mml>` a11y nodes (overflow:hidden, a few

    # `band` (the full-width portrait content band) never enters the

    # inner panel that clips via its own `max-height; overflow:hidden`
    # (e.g. a scroll-box around a wide table) is NOT scanned -- only the
    # role container itself. `overflow: visible` is never flagged: that
    # content spills VISIBLY and the existing gap/spread gate already sees
