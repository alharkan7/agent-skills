"""run_gates - canonical gate orchestrator for HTML academic posters.

Runs the five poster gates in their fixed canonical order and writes a
single ``GATE_REPORT.json`` that the SKILL workflow (and any reviewer)
reads to decide pass/fail and find the full fix surface in one shot::

    preflight -> style -> asset -> measure -> polish

WHY an orchestrator instead of calling each gate by hand:

  - The order is load-bearing. ``preflight`` is a cheap static lint that
    catches the bugs (LaTeX residue, missing images, broken roles) that
    would otherwise burn an expensive render cycle in ``measure`` /
    ``polish``; ``style`` and ``asset`` source-gate the design before we
    pay for rendering at all. Putting that order in one script keeps it
    from drifting across callers.
  - Default ACCUMULATE: a poster author wants the WHOLE fix surface at
    once, not a stop-at-first-error trickle. ``--fail-fast`` is opt-in
    for CI that only cares whether the build is green.
  - The vendored ``poster_check.py`` keeps its own subcommand CLI
    (preflight / measure / polish) and the new sibling gates
    (style_check.py / asset_check.py) keep theirs, so the vendor diff
    stays clean. This file is pure orchestration: it shells out to each,
    parses what it can, and aggregates into the §7 schema.

Integration contract (DESIGN_FINAL.md §7, IMPLEMENTATION_CONVENTIONS.md
§C): child processes run with ``sys.executable``, ``cwd`` = the poster
HTML's directory (so relative ``assets/...`` paths resolve), and the
gate script paths are resolved relative to THIS file's location -- never
the cwd -- so the orchestrator is position-independent.

Exit code: 0 = overall PASS (zero hard failures), 1 = at least one hard
failure, 2 = usage / environment error.

posterly adaptation (vendored + modified -- see ../NOTICE.md): the asset
gate is OPT-IN. Without ``--manifest`` it is reported ``NOT_RUN`` and
excluded from ``overall`` (real-figure provenance simply not checked),
rather than being run, crashing on its required ``--manifest`` (child
exit 2), and being silently counted as a pass. Conversely, a HARD gate
that ends in SKIPPED from a real environment error (missing playwright /
script, child exit 2) now counts as a failure instead of a silent pass.
