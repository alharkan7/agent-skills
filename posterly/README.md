p⊕sterly turns a paper into a print-ready conference poster at the exact canvas size you set — ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, or custom. Command-line checks catch overflow, misalignment, and off-palette styling before you print.

**Two ways to use it:**

- **Open-source skill (this repo).** Clone it and drive it from a coding agent — Claude Code, Codex, or any agent that supports skills. Runs on your machine; needs no posterly account.
- **Hosted service.** [**tryposterly.com**](https://tryposterly.com) runs it for you, **now open to everyone**, pay-as-you-go, in two engine tiers: Claude + GPT (best practice) and GPT-only at a quarter of the price ([pricing](https://tryposterly.com/pricing)).

If you don't run a coding agent, or wouldn't trust yours with this, and you want posterly at its best without the setup, use the hosted service. It costs money, and every order comes with a receipt.

The [blog](https://tryposterly.com/blog) walks through how posterly turns a paper into a checked, print-ready poster.

## News

- **2026-08-04** · 💸 **A GPT-only tier at a quarter of the price.** GPT-5.6-sol optimizes hard toward a stated goal, which made a recipe possible in which GPT alone runs the whole pipeline and converges in far fewer rounds. Same hard gates, 25% of the Claude + GPT price; the cost is a little design flair and a little care in the small details. See [pricing](https://tryposterly.com/pricing) and the [gallery](https://tryposterly.com/gallery).
- **2026-08-04** · 💳 **WeChat Pay is enabled**, alongside cards at checkout.
- **2026-07-25** · 🎉 **The hosted service is open to everyone** — no invite, no waitlist. Pay-as-you-go, itemized receipt per order; see [pricing](https://tryposterly.com/pricing).
- **2026-07-19** · 🎨 **A *dramatically* wider design range** — posterly now composes many more distinct design directions per paper. See the [blog](https://tryposterly.com/blog) and [`templates/DESIGN-AXES.md`](templates/DESIGN-AXES.md).
- **2026-07-18** · 🚀 **[tryposterly.com](https://tryposterly.com) is live** — website, [blog](https://tryposterly.com/blog), and the hosted cloud service. ~~Private beta; payments not yet enabled.~~
- **2026-07-05 – 07-12** · ⭐ **~50 posters at ICML 2026** were made with posterly.

## Showcase

**Nine examples, not nine templates.** posterly composes each direction from choices in layout, typography, palette, framing, density, and masthead — these nine are a sample of the combinations available. Below is one paper ([*PowerFlow*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.18363), ICML 2026) run through it nine times: the paper and content are held fixed, so only the design varies. Every one passes posterly's hard checks.

## Why HTML + CSS, not LaTeX?

- **Fast preview.** Edit CSS and refresh — no recompile step.
- **Modern layout.** Flexbox, grid, gradients, `text-wrap: balance`, and web fonts are available directly, without stacking LaTeX poster packages.
- **Checkable in code.** "Is this column overflowing?" becomes a Playwright geometry query instead of a visual guess.
- **Exact print size.** `@page { size: 60in 36in }` with Chromium's `page.pdf()` produces a PDF whose dimensions match the canvas.

Math is typeset with MathJax rather than natively by the browser: templates use the CDN when opened directly, and the gate/preview renders serve a bundled copy, so measurement works offline. [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) has the details.

## Install

**Install with an agent.** Paste to your coding agent:

> Install this skill for me: https://github.com/Chenruishuo/posterly

It clones the repo, installs the Python dependencies, and runs the smoke test. The manual steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone where your agent discovers skills — e.g. ~/.claude/skills/ for Claude Code
#    (other agents: use their skills directory)
git clone https://github.com/Chenruishuo/posterly ~/.claude/skills/posterly
cd ~/.claude/skills/posterly

# 2. Python deps
python -m pip install "playwright>=1.40"
python -m playwright install chromium
# On a fresh Linux box you may also need the system libs Chromium links against:
#   python -m playwright install --with-deps chromium
#   # or sudo apt install libnss3 libatk1.0-0 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libcups2 \
#   #                     libdrm2 libxkbcommon0 libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 \
#   #                     libxrandr2 libgbm1 libpango-1.0-0 libcairo2 libasound2

# 3. System dep for verify-final's pdfinfo
#    Linux:   apt install poppler-utils
#    macOS:   brew install poppler
#    Windows: choco install poppler

# 4. Smoke test
cd examples/hello_world
python ../../tools/poster_check.py preflight  poster.html
python ../../tools/poster_check.py measure    poster.html
python ../../tools/poster_check.py polish     poster.html
python ../../tools/render_preview.py          poster.html
python ../../tools/poster_check.py verify-final poster_preview.pdf --from-html poster.html

# 5. (dev) run the test suite
python -m pip install "pytest>=7" && python -m pytest
```

The `poster_check.py` calls should print `PASS`, and `render_preview.py` should write `poster_preview.pdf` + `poster_preview.png`. posterly is clone-only (no PyPI); `pyproject.toml` holds the dependencies and pytest config.

---

## Use the skill

Point your agent at the paper's source directory:

> Use the posterly skill to make my ICML 2026 poster from the LaTeX project at ~/papers/mypaper/. Logos are in ~/papers/mypaper/logos/, and the QR code should link to https://github.com/you/yourcode

In Claude Code, `/posterly` is the shortcut for that.

The LaTeX source is the only required input; the agent reads it directly and is instructed to ground every number and claim in the paper. Venue, logos, a QR target, brand colors, style preferences, and text density are optional — the agent asks for any it needs before drafting.

You don't choose a look from a list. posterly renders two or three different design directions as thumbnails, you pick one by eye, and it then fills, checks, and exports that poster — each one carrying a light touch of posterly's own house style. Read the workflow overview on the [blog](https://tryposterly.com/blog); the full design reference is in [`templates/DESIGN-AXES.md`](templates/DESIGN-AXES.md).

Direct PDF input (instead of LaTeX) is untested so far.

└── tests/                ← pytest suite
```

The checks, briefly:

- **`run_gates.py`** runs `preflight → style → asset → measure → polish` into one report (`asset` is reported `NOT_RUN` without a `--manifest`). It's the default loop while drafting.
- **`poster_check.py`** exposes the checks individually — `preflight` (static lint), `measure` (print-emulated geometry), `pack` and `fit-logos` (advisory pre-checks), `polish` (soft visual checks), and `verify-final` (post-render PDF sanity, run separately on the exported PDF).

Each command supports `--help`; [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) has the thresholds and tuning flags, and [`templates/README.md`](templates/README.md) the template conventions.

---

## Editing by hand

For manual editing, copy the closest scaffold from [`templates/`](templates/) and change the shared values in its `:root` token block — the style gate expects colors and sizes to come from there, not from individual elements. A tokenized poster keeps its gate metadata in `design_tokens.json`.

- Template contracts — [`templates/README.md`](templates/README.md)
- Design options — [`templates/DESIGN-AXES.md`](templates/DESIGN-AXES.md)
- Palette and token reference — [`templates/THEMES.md`](templates/THEMES.md)
- Copy voice / de-AI style pass — [`templates/WRITING.md`](templates/WRITING.md)
- Full agent workflow — [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md)

(`examples/hello_world` is a minimal install/test fixture, not a general starting point.)
