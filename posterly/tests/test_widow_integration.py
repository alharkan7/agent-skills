"""Chromium-gated integration test for the prose-WIDOW geometry inside
``polish``'s ``_POLISH_JS`` (section 8).

The mocked unit tests in ``test_polish_output.py`` feed the Python loop a
canned ``widows`` list and never run the JS, so the detection itself --
``<br>``-segment splitting, per-token ``Range`` measurement, NBSP-as-
separator tokenising, zero-width wrap-space filtering, visual-line grouping,
and the WIDTH-based runt test -- is only exercised here against a real
headless Chromium.

Determinism: the gate now flags by the last line's WIDTH (a last line filling
< 35% of the widest line is a stranded runt), NOT by word count. So the "must
flag" cases end with a word LONGER than the callout placed SECOND-TO-LAST: it
overflows its line and forces a SHORT final marker onto a line of its own,
where the marker fills a tiny fraction of the (penult-width) measure regardless
of small font-metric differences across machines. The "must not flag" cases
either fill the last line (a single long word, a wide glued tail, or a tiny
word fused to a WIDE inline equation) or carry MEDIA (a figure/icon/table) or a
punctuation-only equation tail on the last line. A short text tail ending in
inline MATH (e.g. "by λ.") DOES flag -- only media/pure-equation tails are
exempt. Skipped when Playwright / Chromium isn't installed.
